Check and mail barometric pressure:

API used:

One call API

Pre requsistes:

LAT long of the location 

Process:
This program can be run using crontab everyday before 6am everyday .

Problem Statement:
Check barometric pressure everyday of a region between 6am and 6pm.
Mail user if baromateric pressure falls below 995 for any hour

Pre requisites and dependancies:
1.Latitude and longtitude of the region to be monitored

Solution:

1.Pull hourly forecast data from the One call API mentioned below
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall/timemachine?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&dt={time}&appid={API key} for each hour from
6 am to 6pm

2.Set a condition in the program to store all the pressures and its respective timestamp if the pressure is found below 995
for any hour

3. Mail the user the pressures and the timestamp if the condtion 2 was true atleast once.

4. Run a cron job before 6 am(based on region time zone) everyday to send automatic remainder email of the pressure forecast of the day.


Program 
1.Determine the date in the region based on the Lat and long provided
2.Calculate the Unix timestamp of the date determined in step 1 (midnight time stamp of the date)
3.Increment time stamp with 6 hours (6am) and run the data pull api for each hour by incrementing the Unix timestamp 
by 3600 seconds
4.In each API JSON response determine if the pressure is below 995
	If the Pressure is below 995 store the pressure and timestamp in a string
	If more than one pressure is below 995 concat the pressure and timestamp in the string
5.Once all Api calls are over (until 6pm) run a script to send email with the body of the message string of the pressures 
below 995 and the timestamp
